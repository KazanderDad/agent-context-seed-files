# Agent Context & Agent Seed Files
This repo contains seed files available to developers and agents to pull from into their own repos.
- seed files, e.g. ci.yml
- agent-context file templates
- agent-instruction files with specific instructions if needed

These files area opinionated towards nextjs projects with supabase using pnpm. They work well with projects build on Vercel's v0.dev and OpenAI's Codex
The AGENNT.md file is a boilerplate seed file to be copied and updated for your context (it is not an agent.md file for this repo)
